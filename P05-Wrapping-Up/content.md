Hopefully you had fun making generative art! As you progressed through this playground, you should have learned about functions, how to call them, and even how to create your own.

## Share your art

Did you make something awesome? Take a screenshot and share it with us [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/IxceFDoZb4xvIdtLKpxW) so we can feature your work!

> You can take a screenshot (picture of the screen) on OS X by pressing `command`, `shift`, and `4` at the same time then clicking and dragging over the area you want to screenshot. You should see a new screenshot file on your desktop.
