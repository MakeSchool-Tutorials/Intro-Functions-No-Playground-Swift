## Rotate by ninety degrees

Let's try a new function: `rotateNinety`. Remember, function calls are followed by parentheses! Enter the following line of code and watch the visualization to see what happens!

```
rotateNinety()
```

## What happened?

The triangle should have rotated the triangle ninety degrees counter-clockwise (to the left or in the opposite direction of a clock's hands). The `rotateNinety` function has a different name than the `moveFifty` function and each function executes a different set of code.

> [action]
> What happens if you combine calls to `moveFifty` with calls to `rotateNinety`? Go back to the space above where you originally called `rotateNintey` and try it out! Can you draw anything cool?

> [info]
> Make sure each function call is on a separate line and don't forget the parentheses!

# Draw a Square!

We now know how to use two functions:

```
moveFifty()
```

```
rotateNinety()
```

Grab a pen and some paper. Seriously, it might seem a bit silly but follow along here and actually complete the pen and paper exercise. I'll wait... We'll be doing pen and paper _pseudocode_ exercises throughout this course so we might as well get started now.

> [action]
> ## Plan your code

> Draw a square on your paper. How would you use _the above functions_ to draw a square? Write it out each step with pen and paper. Read back each line of code to yourself and "perform" each function by hand.
>
> Did you successfully draw a square? If not, that's okay -- give it another shot! If you're still having trouble, try slowly drawing a square by hand again. This time, describe to yourself what you are doing as you do it.

## Pseudocode

> [action]
> Did you actually do the above exercise? If not, go back to _Plan your code_ and do it. We're working to instill good habits in you as you learn to code!

> [info]
> Planning out code on paper or a whiteboard is generally called _pseudocoding_. The purpose of _pseudocoding_ is not to write perfect, syntactically-correct code. In fact, it's better if you don't hold yourself back by trying to get everything perfect. _Psuedocoding_ is a planning exercise for coding. It helps you make a plan before you get started coding. Most people would agree that you shouldn't take a road trip without some sort of navigation --  coding is the same! Make sure you have a rough idea of where you're going before you start typing.

## Coding time!

> [challenge]
> Now that you're pretty sure you have some working pseudocode, it's time to put it to the test... Try out the procedure you created below `// drawing code goes below here` but above `// drawing code goes above here` (remove all the previous old code). Remember, this is real coding again -- syntax matters! Each function call should be on a separate line and don't forget the parentheses. Run the project to test it out!
